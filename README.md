## About Me

I am a data scientist with a background in electrical engineeringâœ¨. I work at the intersection, union, or mutual exclusivity of power systems, data and machine learning. In this profile, I explore and sive into interesting "microtopics" on the fields above. The projects are a brainchild of either my thought processes when tackling tasks at work, a hurdle faced, or a realization in my exploratory endeavors. I aim to contribute thoughtfully in these areas. Feel free to engage me on any of the topics.

- ðŸ”­ Some micro-topics I have explored:
    - Visualization of different types of geological data
    - Power quality and reliability vs energy justice
    - Use of error bars (and other ways) in expressing estimation uncertainty
    - Customer-level voltage measurements and what they can tell us about the electricity grid (e.g. can we tell a transformer open-phase condition?)
    - Use of Kalman filter on frequency measurements to possibly isolate generation sources?
